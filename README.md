# Our research work: Transient Stability Studies using SMIB Emulator, presented at the International Conference on Frontiers in Engineering, Applied Sciences and Technology, NIT, Trichy, April 2018, pp.145-152, ISBN: 978-81-908388-6-3
Transient stability model of an SMIB based on swing equation is modelled and simulated using MATLAB. 
Power system stability can be modeled as a second order nonlinear differential equation known as swing equation.
